<h3>Thesis:</h3>
Spatial frequency (SF) is shown to be a critical characteristic in object perception. However, there exists a lack of understanding of how the SF is represented in the brain, specifically in higher areas in the visual system hierarchy. To address this issue, we conducted extracellular recordings from macaque monkeys to investigate the representation of SF in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of SF on complex object representation.
