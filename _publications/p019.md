<h3> Abstract </h3>
The spread of fake news has become more prevalent given the popularity of social media and the various news that circulates on it. As a result, it is crucial to discern between real and fake news. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous tweets, posts, and news about this illness in social media and electronic media worldwide. This research presents a bilingual model combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and the BERT transformer to detect COVID-19 fake news in both Persian and English. First, the dataset is prepared in Persian and English, and then the proposed method is used to detect COVID-19 fake news on the prepared dataset. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the f1-score. As a result of this approach, we achieve 92.18% accuracy, which shows that adding topic information to the pre-trained contextual representations given by the BERT network, significantly improves the solving of instances that are domain-specific. Also, the results show that our proposed approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
