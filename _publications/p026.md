<h3> Abstract </h3>
Here, we propose a three-stream structure for hand gender recognition. The proposed method employs convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and classification parts to avoid any hand-designed feature extraction procedure. The performance of the proposed method is investigated by using a large hand dataset.
