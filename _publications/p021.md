<h3> Abstract </h3>
Getting around CAPTCHAs is essential for stopping fraudulent online activity. The creation of efficient CAPTCHA-breaking algorithms in the context of Persian can help safeguard Farsi-speaking users from a variety of online dangers and enhance their overall online experience. This study offers a novel method for recognizing Persian CAPTCHAs, which was developed and tested on a large and distinctive dataset. Our approach to Farsi CAPTCHA recognition leverages deep learning models, specifically a combination of the TPS-Resnet-BiLSTM-ATTN model, which surpasses other approaches and breaks Farsi CAPTCHAs with the highest possible accuracy. We have achieved amazing results with promising implications for boosting the security and usability of many online services that depend on CAPTCHA authentication by delving deeply into the impact of attention modules on CAPTCHA recognition.
