<h3> Abstract </h3>
The more social media take its place in our lives; the more critical their analysis becomes and the more researchers’ attention is drawn to it. Studies contain various topics such as sentiment analysis, trend prediction, bot detection, Etc. Here, for the first time, we propose a novel method to predict the job title of social media users. Twitter, a popular social media, is our target social media. We introduce a dataset consisting of 1314 samples, including users’ tweets and bios. The user’s job title is found using Wikipedia crawling. The challenge of multiple job titles per user is handled using a semantic word embedding and clustering method. Then, a job prediction method is introduced based on a deep neural network and TF-IDF word embedding. We also use hashtags and emojis in the tweets for job prediction. Results show that the job title of users in Twitter could be well predicted with 54% accuracy in nine categories.
