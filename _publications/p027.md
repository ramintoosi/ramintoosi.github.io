<h3> Abstract </h3>
In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement towards enhancing the depth and relevance of model-generated responses. This paper introduces a novel hybrid RAG framework that synergizes the Sentence-Window and Parent-Child methodologies with an innovative re-ranking mechanism, aimed at optimizing the query response capabilities of LLMs. By leveraging external knowledge sources more effectively, the proposed method enriches LLM outputs with greater accuracy, relevance, and information fidelity. We subject our hybrid model to rigorous evaluation against benchmark datasets and metrics, demonstrating its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art RAG techniques. The results highlight our methodâ€™s enhanced ability to generate responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also demonstrate a high degree of faithfulness to the source material, thereby setting a new standard for query response enhancement in LLMs. Our study underscores the potential of hybrid RAG models in refining the interaction between LLMs and external knowledge, paving the way for future research in the field of NLP.
