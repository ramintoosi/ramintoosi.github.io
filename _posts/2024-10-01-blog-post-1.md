## Introduction:

In the world of deep learning, deploying models on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, IoT devices, or edge computing platforms presents unique challenges. To ensure efficient performance, it's crucial to reduce model size and enhance inference speed without significantly compromising accuracy. Two popular techniques to achieve this are quantization and pruning.

Quantization refers to reducing the precision of the numbers used to represent a model’s weights and activations, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower precision formats like 8-bit integers. This results in faster computation and lower memory usage. On the other hand, pruning reduces the number of parameters in a model by removing redundant or less important connections, leading to a more compact and faster model.

This project showcases a practical implementation of quantization and pruning on a ResNet model using PyTorch. By combining these techniques, we can demonstrate how to create lightweight, efficient models suited for deployment, all while maintaining high accuracy. Whether you are a machine learning practitioner aiming to optimize your models or just exploring model compression techniques, this project serves as an educational guide to help you get started with quantization and pruning in PyTorch.

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ramintoosi/resnet-quantization-pruning.git
    cd resnet-quantization-pruning
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    ```
   or
    ```sh
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
   ```

## Training a Simple Base Model

Before diving into quantization and pruning, the first step is to train a simple base model without applying any optimization techniques. In this project, we use a standard ResNet architecture to train on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This base model will serve as the foundation for comparing the effects of quantization and pruning later on.

The training script, `train_simple_model.py`, initializes the ResNet model and trains it using typical components such as an Adam optimizer, a cross-entropy loss function, and a learning rate scheduler. By running this script, you will obtain a well-trained model that can later be optimized using various compression techniques.

The training process involves the following key steps:
- **Model**: A ResNet model with 10 output classes (suitable for CIFAR-10) is instantiated.
- **Device**: The model is trained on a GPU if available, or falls back to CPU.
- **Optimizer**: The Adam optimizer is used to adjust the model parameters.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: A `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler is applied to reduce the learning rate when the validation loss stops improving.

To train the model from scratch, simply run the following command:

```sh
python train_model_simple.py
```

This will begin the training process and save the best model to `weights/simple_best_model.pth`. The dataset loading and training loop details are abstracted within the `train()` function and the `load_data()` function, which you can refer to in my previous post on [weak supervision](https://ramintoosi.ir/posts/2023/08/blog-post-1/).

After training this base model, we'll be ready to explore how quantization and pruning can be applied to improve model efficiency.

## Model Validation

Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance on a validation dataset to measure accuracy, loss, and inference speed. The validation process, implemented in the `validate()` function, ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Here is the validation script.

```python
"""
This module validates and calculates the accuracy of a model on MNIST validation data.
"""
import time

import torch
from tqdm import tqdm

from data import load_data


def validate(model, device, n_total=2000):
    """
    Validate the model on the validation data.

    :param n_total: the number of images to validate.
    :param device: cuda or cpu.
    :param model: Model to validate.
    :return: Tuple of accuracy, loss, and average inference time (ms).
    """
    dataloaders = load_data(batch_size=1, num_workers=0)
    model.eval()
    model.to(device)
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    running_loss = 0.0
    start_time = time.time()
    i_data = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in tqdm(dataloaders['val'], total=n_total, desc='Validating model', unit=' image'):
            images, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

            outputs = model(images)

            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
            running_loss += torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(outputs, labels).item()

            i_data += 1

            if i_data > n_total:
                break

    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    accuracy = correct / total
    loss = running_loss / total
    avg_inference_time = elapsed_time / total
    return accuracy, loss, avg_inference_time * 1000
```

## Post-Training Quantization in PyTorch

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique for reducing the size and improving the efficiency of deep learning models. It allows us to convert a pre-trained floating-point model into a quantized version without requiring retraining. In PyTorch, this is achieved using several quantization strategies, such as *dynamic quantization* and *static quantization*. Below is a detailed explanation of the functions used in this module to perform quantization.

# from memory rather than computing the matrix multiplications.

### 1. Dynamic Quantization

Dynamic quantization applies quantization only to weights and quantizes activations dynamically during inference. This is useful when the execution time of a model is dominated by memory-bound operations like loading weights.
According to the PyTorch website:

_Dynamic Quantization: This method quantizes only the activations during inference, while weights
are quantized beforehand. This means that the quantization overhead occurs during the forward pass, but
since it happens on-the-fly, there's no additional pre-processing step needed.
Therefore, inference time remains unaffected.
This is used for situations where the model execution time is dominated by loading weights
from memory rather than computing the matrix multiplications._


#### Function: `quantize_dynamic`

- **Purpose**: This function converts a pre-trained model into a dynamically quantized model by reducing the precision of weights (typically from FP32 to int8).
- **How it works**:
    - It takes the floating-point model (`model_fp32`) and the target data type (`dtype`, usually `torch.qint8`).
    - It only quantizes specific layers, such as `torch.nn.Linear`, where matrix multiplications dominate computation.
    
    ```python
    model_quantized = torch.ao.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
        model_fp32,  # original model
        {torch.nn.Linear},  # layers to quantize
        dtype=dtype  # target dtype for quantized weights
    )
    ```

### 2. Static Quantization

Static quantization quantizes both weights and activations before inference. It requires calibration to estimate the dynamic range of activations by running representative data through the model.

#### Function: `quantize_static`

- **Purpose**: This function implements static quantization by converting the model into a fully quantized version with both weights and activations quantized.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Model Wrapper**: The model is wrapped using `ModelWrapper`, which introduces `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub`. These stubs manage the conversion between floating-point and quantized tensors during the forward pass.
    
        ```python
        model_fp32 = ModelWrapper(model)
        ```
    2. **Quantization Configuration**: The `qconfig` specifies how the model will be quantized. For example, `'x86'` is used for server inference, while `qnnpack` is suited for mobile devices.
    
        ```python
        qconfig = quan.get_default_qconfig('x86')
        model_fp32.qconfig = qconfig
        ```
    3. **Prepare for Quantization**: The model is prepared for quantization by inserting observers that track the ranges of activations.
    
        ```python
        model_fp32_prepared = torch.ao.quantization.prepare(model_fp32)
        ```
    4. **Calibration**: The prepared model is calibrated by passing a subset of the training data through it to estimate the ranges of activations. This step is crucial for determining scaling factors for quantization.
    
        ```python
        for data, _ in tqdm(dataloader['train'], desc='Calibrating model', unit=' batch'):
            model_fp32_prepared(data.to(device))
        ```
    5. **Convert to Quantized Model**: After calibration, the model is converted to a fully quantized version. This step replaces the floating-point operations with quantized versions.
    
        ```python
        model_int8 = torch.ao.quantization.convert(model_fp32_prepared)
        ```

### 3. FX Graph Mode Quantization

The *FX Graph Mode* provides a more flexible approach to quantization by allowing users to modify the model's computational graph.

#### Function: `quantize_static_fx`

- **Purpose**: This function applies static quantization using PyTorch's *FX Graph Mode* API. It allows fine-tuning of the quantization process by manipulating the model's computational graph.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Model Preparation**: The model is deep-copied and prepared for quantization. `qconfig_mapping` specifies how the layers are quantized, while `prepare_fx()` converts the model into a graph form suitable for quantization.
    
        ```python
        model_prepared = quantize_fx.prepare_fx(model_to_quantize, qconfig_mapping, (torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)),))
        ```
    2. **Calibration**: Like static quantization, the model is calibrated by running a sample of training data to estimate the quantization parameters.
    
        ```python
        for data, _ in tqdm(dataloader['train'], desc='Calibrating model FX', unit=' batch'):
            model_prepared(data.to(device))
        ```
    3. **Conversion**: After calibration, the model is quantized by replacing floating-point operators with their quantized counterparts using `convert_fx()`.
    
        ```python
        model_quantized = quantize_fx.convert_fx(model_prepared)
        ```

### Summary

- **Dynamic Quantization**: Quantizes only weights, with activations quantized on-the-fly during inference. It's suitable when memory operations dominate.
- **Static Quantization**: Quantizes both weights and activations but requires calibration with representative data. It's ideal for a more compact, efficient model at inference time.
- **FX Graph Mode Quantization**: Offers a flexible way to manipulate the model's computational graph and quantize it with better control.

Each quantization method has its own use case depending on the deployment environment and model performance goals.


## Post-Training Quantization Script

This section describes the implementation of post-training quantization in PyTorch, where different quantization techniques are applied to an already trained ResNet model. The primary goal is to compare the accuracy, loss, and inference time of the original and quantized models.

The script quantizes the ResNet model using three different PTQ techniques: **dynamic quantization**, **static quantization**, and **FX static quantization**, and then validates the models' performance.

```python

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

1. **Loading the Pre-Trained Model**:
    - First, we load a pre-trained ResNet model that has been trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
    ```python
    model = get_model(num_classes=10)
    checkpoint = "weights/original_model.pt"
    if isfile(checkpoint):
        model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint))
    else:
        model.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights/simple_best_model.pt")["model_state_dict"])
        torch.save(model.state_dict(), "weights/original_model.pt")
    ```

2. **Dynamic Quantization**:
    ```python
    model_quantized = quantize_dynamic(model, dtype=torch.qint8)
    checkpoint_quantized = "weights/quantized_dynamic_model.pt"
    if not isfile(checkpoint_quantized):
        torch.save(model_quantized.state_dict(), checkpoint_quantized)
    ```

3. **Static Quantization**:
   ```python
    checkpoint_quantized_static = "weights/quantized_static_model.pt"
    if isfile(checkpoint_quantized_static):
        model_quantized_static = torch.jit.load(checkpoint_quantized_static)
    else:
        model_quantized_static = quantize_static(model)
        traced = torch.jit.trace(model_quantized_static, torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)))
        torch.jit.save(traced, checkpoint_quantized_static)
    ```

4. **Static Quantization with FX (Graph Mode)**:
    ```python
    checkpoint_quantized_static_fx = "weights/quantized_static_fx_model.pt"
    if isfile(checkpoint_quantized_static_fx):
        model_quantized_static_fx = torch.jit.load(checkpoint_quantized_static_fx)
    else:
        model_quantized_static_fx = quantize_static_fx(model)
        traced = torch.jit.trace(model_quantized_static_fx, torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)))
        torch.jit.save(traced, checkpoint_quantized_static_fx)
    ```

5. **Model Validation**:
    - The original and quantized models are validated on the CIFAR-10 validation dataset using the `validate()` function.
    - This function calculates the **accuracy**, **loss**, and **average inference time** for each model.
    ```python
    accuracy, loss, inference_time = validate(model, device)
    ...
    ```

6. **Results Comparison**:
    - Finally, the script prints out the results of the original and quantized models, including accuracy, loss, and inference time.
    ```python
    print(f"Original model accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}, loss: {loss:.4f}, inference time: {inference_time:.2f}ms")
    ...
    ```

## Model Pruning Function

This section covers the **model pruning** function, which is used to reduce the number of parameters in a neural network by making the model weights sparse. In this particular implementation, **L1 unstructured pruning** is applied to both `Conv2d` and `Linear` layers of the model.

Pruning helps reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of a model, which can be useful for deploying models on resource-constrained environments. Here’s a breakdown of how the pruning function works.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.utils.prune as prune

def make_sparse(model_to_prune, rate=0.5):
    """
    This function prunes the model by making the weights sparse.
    :param model_to_prune: model to prune
    :param rate: the percentage of weights to prune
    """
    for name, module in model_to_prune.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
            prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=rate)
            prune.remove(module, 'weight')
        elif isinstance(module, torch.nn.Linear):
            prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=rate)
            prune.remove(module, 'weight')

```

#### Code Explanation

1. **Iterating through the Model's Layers**:
    - The function uses `named_modules()` to loop through all the layers of the model and check their types.
    - If the layer is a `Conv2d` or `Linear` layer, pruning is applied to its weights.
    - **L1 Unstructured Pruning**: The function applies L1-norm pruning to remove a specified percentage of weights with the smallest absolute values.

```python
    for name, module in model_to_prune.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
            prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=rate)
```

2. **Pruning the Weights**:
    - `prune.remove()` is called afterward to finalize the pruning process and remove the pruning mask from the model. This makes the sparsity permanent, converting zeroed-out weights into actual zeros in the model.

```python
            prune.remove(module, 'weight')
```

3. **Applying the Same Pruning to Linear Layers**:
    - The same pruning process is applied to `Linear` layers to make them sparse as well.

```python
        elif isinstance(module, torch.nn.Linear):
            prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=rate)
            prune.remove(module, 'weight')
```

## Pruning and Quantization Script Explanation

This script combines **pruning** and **post-training static quantization** on a ResNet model to optimize its size and inference performance. Pruning reduces the number of parameters by making the weights sparse, and quantization further compresses the model by reducing the precision of the weights and activations.

# validate models
device = torch.device("cpu")
accuracy, loss, inference_time = validate(model_orig, device, n_total=100)
accuracy_quantized, loss_quantized, inference_time_quantized = validate(model_quantized_prune, device, n_total=100)

# print the results
print(f"Original model accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}, loss: {loss:.4f}, inference time: {inference_time:.2f}ms")
print(f"Quantized static model accuracy: {accuracy_quantized:.2f}, loss: {loss_quantized:.2f}, "
      f"inference time: {inference_time_quantized:.2f}ms")

```

Here’s a breakdown of each part of the script:


### Loading the Original Model

```python
model = get_model(num_classes=10)
checkpoint = "weights/original_model.pt"
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint))

model_orig = copy.deepcopy(model)
```


- A ResNet model for 10 classes (e.g., CIFAR-10) is loaded using the `get_model()` function.
- The model's weights are loaded from a saved checkpoint (`original_model.pt`), ensuring it starts from a pre-trained state.
- `model_orig` is a deep copy of the original model, used later for comparison purposes.

### Pruning and Quantization

```python
checkpoint_quantized_prune = "weights/quantized_prune_model.pt"
if isfile(checkpoint_quantized_prune):
    model_quantized_prune = torch.jit.load(checkpoint_quantized_prune)
else:
    make_sparse(model)
    model_quantized_prune = quantize_static_fx(model)
    traced = torch.jit.trace(model_quantized_prune, torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)))
    torch.jit.save(traced, checkpoint_quantized_prune)
```
   - The script checks if a quantized and pruned model (`quantized_prune_model.pt`) already exists.
   - If it exists, the pruned and quantized model is loaded using TorchScript (`torch.jit.load()`).
   - If not, the following steps occur:
     1. **Pruning**: `make_sparse(model)` prunes the weights of the model, making the weights sparse by removing a portion of them.
     2. **Quantization**: `quantize_static_fx(model)` applies **static quantization** using FX graph mode, further optimizing the model.
     3. **Saving**: The model is traced using TorchScript (`torch.jit.trace`) for optimization and portability, then saved for future use.

### Model Validation

```python
# validate models
device = torch.device("cpu")
accuracy_quantized, loss_quantized, inference_time_quantized = validate(model_quantized_prune, device)
```

## Quantization Aware Training (QAT) Script Explanation

This script demonstrates how to perform **Quantization Aware Training (QAT)** on a ResNet model using PyTorch. QAT simulates quantization during training, allowing the model to learn to adjust to the quantized weights and activations. This often results in better accuracy when converting the model to a quantized version compared to post-training quantization.

Here’s a breakdown of the **QAT function** and the corresponding **QAT training script**:



### QAT Function

```python
from torch import nn
from torch.ao.quantization import get_default_qat_qconfig_mapping
import torch.ao.quantization.quantize_fx as quantize_fx
import copy

def prepare_model_qat(model_fp: nn.Module, example_inputs):
    """
    Prepare a model for quantization-aware training (QAT).
    :param model_fp: The floating point model to prepare.
    :param example_inputs: Example inputs for the model, used during preparation.
    :return: A model ready for QAT.
    """
    model_to_quantize = copy.deepcopy(model_fp)  # Deep copy the model to avoid modifying the original one.
    
    # Get the default QAT configuration for the target platform (x86 in this case).
    qconfig_mapping = get_default_qat_qconfig_mapping("x86")
    
    model_to_quantize.train()  # Set the model to training mode.
    
    # Prepare the model for QAT by adding necessary observers and quantization logic.
    model_prepared = quantize_fx.prepare_qat_fx(model_to_quantize, qconfig_mapping, example_inputs)

    return model_prepared
```

1. **Deep Copy of the Model**: The function creates a copy of the original floating point model (`model_fp`) to avoid modifying the original model directly.
   
2. **QAT Config**: It retrieves the **default QAT configuration** for the target platform (`x86`), specifying how the model's layers will be quantized during training.

3. **Training Mode**: The model is set to training mode since QAT requires forward and backward passes to simulate quantization during training.

4. **QAT Preparation**: The function uses `prepare_qat_fx()` from the `torch.ao.quantization` module to prepare the model for quantization-aware training. This adds observers and prepares the model to handle quantized operations during training.

```

#### Model Training with QAT

```python
def train_model_qat(resume=True):
    """
    Train a ResNet model with Quantization Aware Training (QAT).
    """
    device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"Device: {device}")

    dataloaders = load_data(batch_size=128, num_workers=0)

    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()  # Loss function
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # Adam optimizer
    scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.9, patience=5)  # Learning rate scheduler

    train(model_prepared, dataloaders, optimizer, criterion, scheduler,
          device, "qat", 1, resume=resume)
```

   - The model is loaded with the original pre-trained weights.
   - The model is prepared for QAT using the `prepare_model_qat()` function with example inputs from the training data.
   - The script sets up the loss function, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate when the model's performance plateaus.



#### Loading and Quantizing the Model

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    checkpoint = 'weights/qat_fx_model.pt'
    if os.path.isfile(checkpoint):
        model_quantized = torch.jit.load(checkpoint)  # Load the pre-quantized model
    else:
        dataloaders = load_data(batch_size=128, num_workers=0)
        model = get_model(num_classes=10)

        model_prepared = prepare_model_qat(model, example_inputs=next(iter(dataloaders['train']))[0])
        model_prepared.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights/qat_best_model.pt", weights_only=True)["model_state_dict"])

        model_prepared.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode before quantizing.
        model_quantized = quantize_fx.convert_fx(model_prepared)  # Convert the model to quantized format.

        traced = torch.jit.trace(model_quantized, torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)))  # Trace the model with TorchScript.
        torch.jit.save(traced, checkpoint)  # Save the quantized model.
```
- If a pre-quantized model checkpoint exists, it is loaded directly.
- Otherwise, the script prepares the model for QAT and loads the trained QAT model's weights.
- It then converts the QAT-trained model to a fully quantized format using `quantize_fx.convert_fx()`.
- The quantized model is traced with TorchScript and saved to be loaded later.



#### Model Validation

```python
# validation
device = torch.device("cpu")
accuracy, loss, inference_time = validate(model_quantized, device)
print(f"Quantized model (QAT) accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}, loss: {loss:.2f}, inference time: {inference_time:.2f}ms")
```

    print(f"Quantized model (QAT) accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}, loss: {loss:.2f}, inference time: {inference_time:.2f}ms")


```

This script performs both **pruning** and **Quantization Aware Training (QAT)** on a ResNet model using PyTorch. By combining pruning, which reduces the number of weights, and QAT, which trains the model to adjust for quantization, we achieve both model compression and faster inference while maintaining high accuracy.

Here’s a breakdown of the **Pruning and QAT** function and the corresponding **training script**:

### Code Breakdown

#### Model Training with Pruning and QAT

```python
def train_model_qat_prune(resume=True):
    """
    Train a ResNet model with Quantization Aware Training (QAT) and pruning.
    """
    device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"Device: {device}")

    dataloaders = load_data(batch_size=128, num_workers=0)

    model = get_model(num_classes=10)
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights/original_model.pt", weights_only=True))

    # Apply pruning to make the model sparse
    make_sparse(model)

    # Prepare the pruned model for Quantization Aware Training (QAT)
    model_prepared = prepare_model_qat(model, example_inputs=next(iter(dataloaders['train']))[0])

    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()  # Define loss function
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)  # Adam optimizer with a smaller learning rate
    scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.9, patience=5)  # Learning rate scheduler

    # Train the pruned and QAT-prepared model
    train(model_prepared, dataloaders, optimizer, criterion, scheduler,
          device, "qat_prune", 20, resume=resume)
```

1. **Pruning**:
   - The `make_sparse(model)` function prunes the ResNet model by setting a percentage of the model's weights to zero, based on the pruning rate. This function is applied to the model before QAT.

2. **QAT Preparation**:
   - The pruned model is passed through the `prepare_model_qat()` function, which prepares it for Quantization Aware Training by inserting quantization-aware operations into the model. This prepares the model to handle quantized weights during training.

3. **Training Setup**:
   - The script defines the training setup using `CrossEntropyLoss`, the Adam optimizer, and a learning rate scheduler. The learning rate is reduced when the model's performance plateaus.

4. **Training**:
   - The training loop is executed for 20 epochs (`"qat_prune", 20`), adjusting the weights of the pruned and quantization-aware model.


#### Model Loading and Quantization

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    train_model_qat_prune(resume=False)

    checkpoint = 'weights/qat_prune_model.pt'
    if os.path.isfile(checkpoint):
        model_quantized = torch.jit.load(checkpoint)  # Load the pre-quantized model if it exists
    else:
        dataloaders = load_data(batch_size=128, num_workers=0)

        model = get_model(num_classes=10)

        # Apply pruning
        make_sparse(model)

        # Prepare the pruned model for QAT
        model_prepared = prepare_model_qat(model, example_inputs=next(iter(dataloaders['train']))[0])
        model_prepared.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights/qat_prune_best_model.pt", weights_only=True)["model_state_dict"])

        # Convert the QAT-prepared model to a quantized format
        model_prepared.eval()
        model_quantized = quantize_fx.convert_fx(model_prepared)

        # Trace and save the quantized model
        traced = torch.jit.trace(model_quantized, torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224)))
        torch.jit.save(traced, checkpoint)
```

1. **Loading Pre-Trained Model**:
   
2. **Pruning and QAT**:
   - If no checkpoint exists, the model is pruned, and then it is prepared for Quantization Aware Training with `prepare_model_qat()`.
   - After loading the pre-trained weights (`weights/qat_prune_best_model.pt`), the model is converted to its fully quantized form using `quantize_fx.convert_fx()`.

3. **Model Tracing and Saving**:


#### Model Validation

```python
    # Validation step
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    accuracy, loss, inference_time = validate(model_quantized, device)
    print(f"Quantized model (QAT) accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}, loss: {loss:.2f}, inference time: {inference_time:.2f}ms")
```

## Results Summary

These results show the comparison of various model optimization techniques applied to a ResNet model trained on CIFAR-10. The experiments were conducted using an **NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti** GPU, and the results focus on three metrics:

| **Model Type**               | **Accuracy** | **Loss** | **Inference Time**  |
|------------------------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Original model**            | 0.95         | 0.27     | 54.28ms             |
| **PTQ dynamic model**         | 0.96         | 0.27     | 53.95ms             |
| **PTQ static model**          | 0.95         | 0.28     | 22.96ms             |
| **PTQ static model with FX**  | 0.95         | 0.28     | 21.37ms             |
| **Pruned 50% + PTQ static**   | 0.93         | 0.19     | 20.02ms             |
| **QAT**                       | 0.95         | 0.27     | 19.87ms             |
| **Pruned 50% + QAT**          | 0.95         | 0.25     | 20.61ms             |

### Key Observations

1. **Accuracy**:
   - The **original model** achieves 95% accuracy, and both **PTQ** (Post-Training Quantization) and **QAT** (Quantization Aware Training) retain similar levels of accuracy (95%-96%), demonstrating minimal accuracy loss.
   - **Pruned 50% + PTQ static** slightly reduces accuracy to 93%, but applying **QAT** along with pruning helps recover accuracy to 95%.

2. **Inference Time**:
   - **PTQ static models** achieve a significant reduction in inference time, cutting it by over 50% (from 54.28ms to ~21ms).
   - **Pruning and QAT** further reduce the inference time, with **QAT alone** achieving the fastest inference at **19.87ms**.
   - **Pruned 50% + PTQ/QAT models** maintain a low inference time of around 20ms, which is a substantial improvement over the original model.

3. **Loss**:
   - The **original model**, PTQ, and QAT maintain similar loss values (~0.27-0.28).
   - **Pruned models** show a lower loss (0.19-0.25), suggesting that pruning can help reduce overfitting and potentially improve generalization.
## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of post-training quantization (PTQ), quantization-aware training (QAT), and pruning techniques in optimizing the performance of a deep learning model. By applying these techniques to a ResNet model trained on CIFAR-10, we observed substantial improvements in inference time and model efficiency while maintaining accuracy levels close to the original, unoptimized model.

Both static and dynamic quantization techniques, particularly static quantization with FX, significantly reduced inference time without sacrificing accuracy. Similarly, pruning, especially when combined with PTQ or QAT, further enhanced model efficiency while maintaining strong performance metrics.

QAT emerged as a standout technique for producing highly efficient models, yielding minimal accuracy loss and achieving the fastest inference time of 19.87ms. The pruned models also performed well, showing that combining QAT or PTQ with pruning is an effective strategy for improving both model speed and size.

### Takeaways

1. **Quantization is highly effective in optimizing model performance**:

2. **QAT achieves the best balance between speed and accuracy**:

3. **Pruning enhances the benefits of quantization**:
   - Pruning alone can reduce overfitting, as seen in the lower loss values.

4. **Static quantization offers superior speedup compared to dynamic quantization**:

5. **Pruned models show a slight drop in accuracy but perform well overall**:

### Final Thought:
For real-world applications requiring model optimization, **QAT combined with pruning** offers the best balance of speed, accuracy, and efficiency. When ease of implementation is a concern, **PTQ static** is a strong alternative that still provides significant benefits in terms of inference time.
