Neural activity monitoring is one of the bases of understanding the brain behavior. The recorded extracellular potential is a combination of multiple neurons activities corrupted by noise. A main step in analyzing the extracellular data is to differentiate among different neuron activities. Spike sorting is the process of assigning each detected spike to the corresponding neurons. ROSS is a MATLAB based offline spike sorter software which helps the researchers to do automatic and manual spike sorting tasks efficiently. Currently it provides t-distribution and skew-t based methods for automatic spike sorting. Several functions are considered for modifying the auto-sorting results, such as merging and denoising. Also, useful visualizations are provided to get better results.
